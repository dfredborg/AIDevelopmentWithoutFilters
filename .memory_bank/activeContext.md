# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initializing the Memory Bank for the Webshop Integration project. This involves creating the core documentation files that will guide the development process and ensure alignment with the project's architectural goals.

## Recent Changes
*   Created `projectbrief.md`: Defined the project scope and core goals.
*   Created `productContext.md`: Explained the "Why" and the problem/solution fit.
*   Created `systemPatterns.md`: Documented the Staging Pattern architecture and coding rules.
*   Created `techContext.md`: Outlined the technology stack and environment.

## Next Steps
1.  **Clarify Requirements:** Address the open questions in `common/Implementation.md` (Field Mapping, Error Handling, etc.) before starting code implementation.
2.  **Phase 1 Implementation:** Begin creating the Staging Tables (`DEF Webshop Header Staging`, `DEF Webshop Line Staging`).
3.  **Phase 2 Implementation:** Create the UI pages for the staging tables.

## Active Decisions
*   **Staging Pattern:** Confirmed as the architectural choice.
*   **Object ID Range:** `50100..50200` is locked in.
*   **Prefix:** `DEF` is mandatory.
