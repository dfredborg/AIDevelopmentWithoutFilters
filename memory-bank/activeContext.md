# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initialization of the project structure and Memory Bank. The project is in the early stages of development, following the plan outlined in `docs/implementation.md`.

## Recent Changes
*   Created `memory-bank/` directory.
*   Created `productContext.md`.
*   Analyzed `docs/implementation.md` and `apps/MyCoreApp/app.json`.

## Next Steps
1.  Complete the Memory Bank initialization (systemPatterns, techContext, progress).
2.  Begin Phase 1: Data Structure implementation (Enums and Tables).
3.  Proceed to Phase 2: API Layer.

## Active Decisions
*   **ID Range:** Strictly adhering to `50100` - `50200`.
*   **Prefix:** All new objects must start with `DEF`.
*   **Data Types:** All incoming API fields will be `Text` to ensure robustness, with parsing logic handled internally.
*   **Namespace:** `MyCompany.Webshop`.
*   **Folder Structure:** Feature-based organization (`src/Webshop/`).

## Open Questions
*   None at this stage.
